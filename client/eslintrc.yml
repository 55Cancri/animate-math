# NOTES
# 1. using let (taken from https://github.com/jhusain/eslint-plugin-immutable): There's no reason to use let in a Redux/React application, because all your state is managed by either Redux or React. Use const instead, and avoid state bugs altogether.

# 2. using for loops (taken from https://github.com/jhusain/eslint-plugin-immutable): What about for loops? Loops can be replaced with the Array methods like map, filter, and so on. If you find the built-in JS Array methods lacking, use lodash.

# 3. using loops in general (take from https://github.com/buildo/eslint-plugin-no-loops): It's 2019 and you still use loops?
