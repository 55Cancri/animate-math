        # configure the caching behavior for the cdn here. Once assets are placed in the s3 bucket, cloudfront will automatically pull requested files from the bucket when theyâ€™re requested and cache the files in the cloudfront network. It is important to configure reasonable cache settings to avoid excessive data transfer between the s3 bucket and cloudfront since aws charges traffic between s3 and cloudfront.
